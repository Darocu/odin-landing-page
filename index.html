            <h1>Welcome to the Dragon Crest Expanse!</h1>
            <p>The world began with the Age of Dragons. All that existed were 
                mythical creatures of grandesque power. They slowly grew bored
                of each other and created the Age of Giants. These new found humanoids
                of large size overpowered the Dragons. This caused them to spawn the
                world as we know it, The New Age. Humanoids of all shapes and sizes were
                born. Harnessing the power of the Dragons and Giants they overcame all.
                Now they seek the find the king of the world. He who sits upon the Dragon
                Throne.

            <p>“You are not entering this world in the usual manner, 
                for you are setting forth to be a Dungeon Master. 
                Certainly there are stout fighters, mighty magic-users, 
                wily thieves, and courageous clerics who will make their 
                mark in the magical lands of D&D adventure. You however, 
                are above even the greatest of these, for as DM you are 
                to become the Shaper of the Cosmos. It is you who will 
                give form and content to the all the universe. You will 
                breathe life into the stillness, giving meaning and purpose 
                to all the actions which are to follow.”</p>
